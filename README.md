# Pixel Art Scene with Animation - OpenGL Project

## Overview

This project is a 2D pixel art scene created using OpenGL, featuring various animated elements. The goal is to implement interactive and dynamic components that bring the scene to life, following the specified requirements.
All pixel art in this project was custom-made using Procreate.

## Features

1. **Main Character**:
   - The character can move left and right using keyboard arrow keys.
   - Animations or different textures are applied for moving and idle states.
   - A volcano eruption is triggered if the character moves beyond the right edge of the screen.

2. **Sun**:
   - The sun gradually changes its color over time, creating a pulsating effect with shades of yellow and orange.

3. **Clouds**:
   - Clouds move continuously across the screen, looping from one edge to the other.

4. **Environment**:
   - **Volcano**: A static volcano in the background that erupts under specific conditions.
   - **Ground**: A textured surface the character can walk on.
   - **Trees**: Animated tree leaves sway gently to simulate the effect of wind.
   - **Waterfall**: A flowing animation simulates the movement of water.
   - **Signboard**: A sign with a place name, featuring text rendering.

5. **Mouse Interaction**:
   - Clicking anywhere on the screen pauses or resumes all animations.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the main character left or right.
- **Mouse Click**: Toggle pause/play for all animations.
